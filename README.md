# Notepad Application

Notepad applications created using PyQt5 and PyGTK. Currently The PyGTK is WIP.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and pip installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Create a virtual environment and install the project dependencies by running the following command:

`make venv`

This will create a virtual environment named `env` and install the required packages.

## Usage

To run the project, use the following command:

`make run`

This will start the notepad application.

## Options

The following options are available in the Makefile:

- `make venv`: Creates a virtual environment and installs the project dependencies.
- `make run`: Runs the notepad application.
- `make clean`: Removes the virtual environment and cleans up the project directory.

Note: Make sure to activate the virtual environment before running the `make` commands. You can activate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:

- For Windows:

`.\env\Scripts\activate`

- For macOS/Linux:

`source env/bin/activate`

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can use the `make` commands to manage and run the project.
